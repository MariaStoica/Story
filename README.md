# Story

My sentient machine attempt

What is understanding? Can we program a machine to understand to the point where it can learn on its own? If a machine is able to understand then it will be able to empathize. Is it easier to learn if filling words are removed and only the bare concepts are used? What would a data-senzitive data structure look like? (a structure that can reorganize itself ot include new knowledge) I'm trying to answer these questions with Story - the program that communicates and thinks and hopefully understands in story cubes.

Exercise 1: I tell Story a true story (eg: cat,drink,water) and she tells me a true story in return keeping the same category of words (Subject, Action, Object in this case eg: cat,play,ball)
